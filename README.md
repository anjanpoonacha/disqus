## FAQ's

Known reason: The site is not secure.

**How to fix it**: Add `https://` before the url or [click here!](https://disqus-like-reddit.herokuapp.com)

### 2. Why there is still a Login button even after logging in?
I have not implemented the logout functionality yet. I want Login button to navigate through all users. I will fix it once the logout is done.

### 3. Bugs?
Yes, there are a few known bugs. I will fix it in the future.

If you want to report it. Comment about it on the first post.

### 4. Why is it not responsive?
I focused more on the backend logic than frontend. The frontend is built without using any frameworks like Bootstrap, Angular or React. To save myself some time, I left it undone. I will write some Media Queries in the future.
